We've been approached by Showtime about using some of our screen printed band posters as props in an upcoming television show called "The Affair". Season One of the show begins mid-October and airs on the Showtime network. The posters will be shown hanging on the wall of one of the main character's daughter's bedroom. I've gotta say, this girl has excellent taste in music!

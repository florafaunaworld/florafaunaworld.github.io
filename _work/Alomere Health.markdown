### Douglas County Hospital Rebrands to Alomere Health

This rural health system needed help navigating a name change to better position themselves for growth. The county name no longer reflected the culture of the community and limited their potential  for expansion in opening new hospitals and clinics.

> **The Strategy** - We helped engage the stakeholders and the public to see the value in a change that would undoubtedly be emotional for many. Through a process of interviews, research, steering committee meetings, naming, branding, and design, Florafauna helped launch an exciting new chapter for a beloved community hero.
>
> **The Result** - The rebrand launched with great success due to a strategy that first united employees, and then inspired the community with the leadershipâ€™s vision months before the unveiling of the new name.

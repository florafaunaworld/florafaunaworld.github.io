### SUMMIT BREWING 25th ANNIVERSARY

Posters, t–shirts, drink coasters and serving trays are some of the materials we created to celebrate and commemorate Summit Brewing Company’s 25th anniversary. The direction was to communicate the idea of “craft” beer that is locally brewed in St. Paul, MN. Celebrating the love and hard work that goes into making every pint of craft brew. SKOL! to a quarter century!

> "Florafauna demonstrates a clear understanding of Summit’s passion for craft beer. They took the heart of our brewery and breathed our incredible legacy into the materials for our 25th anniversary." <br> – Mark O. Stutrud, Founder & CEO, Summit Brewing Company

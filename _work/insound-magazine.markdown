### INSOUND MAGAZINE

Insound Magazine functions as a promotional hand out and also as a supplement for Insound's online music and product orders. The theme for the 2010 Spring/Summer issue is vinyl. More specifically the behind the scenes process that ultimately puts records into the hands of music fans with a focus on labels, pressing plants, and mastering.

>The magazine was also floating around the 2010 SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas. We wanted the image for the cover to be bright, colorful, and visually appealing weather it was received by mail or picked up off the street.

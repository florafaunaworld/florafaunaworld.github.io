### JOSTEN'S 115 BRAND REFRESH

The Josten's throwback music inspired marketing kit functions as a sales tool with interactive educational and entertainment components. The anthologies were a catalyst for success with sales reps nation-wide, as 2013 became Josten's largest yearbook-sales year to date. We created a totally different brand experience, nearly doubling sales from 4.8 million yearbooks in 2011-12 to more than 8 million in 2013.

> "The sales force and our even our CEO are ecstatic about the entire 115 brand refresh, specifically the album concept. Several have stated that it was the most effective thing they remember us doing. Ever. We’ve excited and empowered our sales force over here!"

### WIRED MAGAZINE ILLUSTRATIONS / EDITORIAL LAYOUT

Conde Nast Publications hired us to create some Illustrations for the "How To" section of the May 2011 issue of Wired Magazine. The topics we were given to illustrate include: How to take great self portraits, how to make crystal clear ice, and how to calculate you maximum heart rate (without vomiting). The Illustrations were also featured in GQ magazine.

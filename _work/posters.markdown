### POSTERS

The challenge that comes along with creating an image that becomes an icon of the memory of the experience is something we’ve always embraced. Add to that the challenge of designing something that people would want to display on the wall of their home for years to come, and you’ve got one tall order. Whether you're a world class brand or a lo-fi band, our approach to designing a poster is always the same. We treat posters as visual extensions of the music, event or message you're trying to communicate. They are cultural artifacts.

>Many of the posters highlighted here are available for purchase in the Florafauna [shop](https://florafauna2.myshopify.com/collections/posters).

### DJ DUO HI-FI/LO-FI

DJ duo Hi-Fi/Lo-Fi pride themselves on their ability to provide and present music sensibility. They focus on playing good and interesting music for your ears. They love the idea of reading the room and playing music that people will want to hear without being too predictable. Think of them as DJs for people who appreciate good music. The visual branding solution is one that reflects all these ideas.

> Hi-Fi/Lo-Fi have held an ongoing residency at the [Guthrie Theatre](https://www.guthrietheater.org/) in Minneapolis for 7 years, spinning tunes during pre and post performance parties.

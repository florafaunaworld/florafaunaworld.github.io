### ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS AND INVESTORS

Ostra is a start up that offers concierge cyber security protection. They build personalized cyber security service plans for small to medium sized businesses with the same security technology used by the massive enterprises and governments. We helped Ostra build a brand personality that is approachable and relatable in a space that is often times seen as technical and confusing to customers and investors.

> Florafauna started rom the ground up by creating a custom logo type and shield protection icon, fonts, colors, custom illustrations that entertain and inform. Bringing it all together with a new website and investor pitch deck that frames up an approachable brand story for a new digital cyber security product.

### ATTRACTING NEW CUSTOMERS AND INVESTORS

Ostra builds personalized cyber security service plans for small to medium sized businesses using the same security technology used by massive enterprises and governments around the world. Think of it as concierge cyber security protection. Florafauna helped Ostra build an approachable  brand personality in a space that is often times seen as technical and confusing.

> We started from the ground up by creating a custom logo type and shield protection icon, fonts, colors, and custom illustrations that aim to entertain and inform. Bringing it all together with a new website and investor pitch deck that frames up their brand story around a new digital cyber security product.

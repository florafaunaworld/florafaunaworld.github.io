We started by crafting an identity that captures the essence of a bygone era. We then infused that nostalgic magic into every facet of the Heimie's Made brand. Master artisan Anthony Andler designed a beautiful collection of bags â€“ each are works of exceptional quality, crafted and assembled by hand with great love and care.

This is a brand of tradition and heritage, determined to make its voice heard in a marketplace that's saturated with second-rate knock offs, me too's, and poorly produced goods. Heimie's Made is a brand rooted in authenticity and purpose. A brand that truly stands for absolute quality and functional design.

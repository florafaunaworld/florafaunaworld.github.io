### INDIAN MOTORCYCLES

Legendary. That defines Indian Motorcycle. Americaâ€™s first motorcycle company, Indian Motorcycle has the richest heritage on two wheels. From global racing dominance, to leading the charge in the fight for freedom, to innovative engineering and visionary thinking that changed motorcycling forever.  We created a series of historical wall panels for the Indian corporate headquarters. Each panel highlighting specific events within the timeline of Indian milestones, such as the annual races held at Daytona Beach.

### HARAJUKU MINI FOR TARGET 2012 LOOK BOOK

Target hired us to design, photo art direct, and produce the look book for Gwen Stefani's kids fashion collection, Harajuku Mini. The line was designed exclusively for Target, inspired by the cool kaleidoscope of colorful styles found on the streets of Harajuku, Japan.

> "The aesthetic is a mash up of plaid, animal print, stripes, and checkered patterns with crazy-cute schoolgirl details like bows, pleats and suspenders. It's grade school rock 'n' roll!"<br>â€“ Gwen Stefani

### TARGET IN–STORE REINVENTION

We worked with Target's inHouse team to create a unified look for the in-store electronics department. Our intent was to elevate the department by showcasing Target’s premium merchandise. The new look evolves department assets resulting in increased brand and product awareness. It reinforces  their valued brand positioning of Expect more. Pay less.

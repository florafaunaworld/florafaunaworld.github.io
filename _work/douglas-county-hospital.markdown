### DOUGLAS COUNTY HOSPITAL

Douglas County Hospital serves the Alexandria, MN community with its whole heart. We created an advertising campaign that spans print, radio, outdoor, and social media platforms. The messaging strategy identifies their unique value proposition as an authentic reflection of the community they take pride in every day.

> For the month of February, we displayed a tree with “heart sticky-note leaves” on site at the clinic. Staff and patients we encouraged to write and post something nice about why they love living in the heartland. We posted the responses to the DCH Facebook page, generating increased social media engagement.
